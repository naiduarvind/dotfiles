# Minulle (dot)files

## Installation

**Warning:** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk!

### Sensible macOS defaults

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible macOS defaults:

```bash
$ ./.macos
```

### Install Homebrew formulae

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to install some common [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) formulae (after installing Homebrew, of course):

```bash
$ ./brew.sh
```

Some of the functionality of these dotfiles depends on formulae installed by `brew.sh`. If you don’t plan to run `brew.sh`, you should look carefully through the script and manually install any particularly important ones.

## Packages

### Brew

### Python
